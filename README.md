# React DI Example

### This is an example of dependency injection in a React app
Network requests and routing logic have been extracted into separate classes, and injected for separation of concerns, and easier testing 

## Branches
- Before - LunchFinder React app without Dependency Injection
- After - LunchFinder React app with Dependency Injection

## Built With
- Node/NPM
- Typescript
- Create React App
- React Hooks
- React Router
- React Testing Library

## Getting Started
- `npm install`
- `npm test`
- `npm start`

## Next Steps
- explore other types of logic that can be injected (e.g. LocalStorage access, Redux, i18n)
